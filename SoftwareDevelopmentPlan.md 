SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

Scope: The scope of this app is to allow the user to order food by selecting dishes from cuisines of their choice.

Statement of Purpose
    What the application will do:    
    This application is an online food delivery app called 'Super Eats'. It enables users to order food from a variety of dishes from various cuisines. The final cart shows them what they have ordered along with the total cost. They can pay using credit/debit card, PayPal,cash on delivery. There is also an option to customise their choice or mention any additional requests such as spice levels, no onions etc. The application then asks for an address to which the food has to be delivered. It also gives the approximate time it would take for delivery.

    The problems this app solves and why I am developing it:   
    1. Food delivery apps have gained so much importance because of smartphone dependence. Nowadays people dont have time to go outside for food. Online ordering mainly solves mobility problems. Customers can order from anywhere - while sitting on a train, in a classroom, while working late from office. 
    2. Another problem it solves is the misunderstandings that occur when ordering via calling the restaurant directly. Restaurant noises, phone connectivity can lead to confusions which is avoided by online ordering as it is directly specified by the customer
    3. Customers have much so much more choice in an online food app, they can choose between different cuisines/dishes
    4. There is no minimum order quantity in this app. It doesnt matter if they can order for one, or order for a house party. 
    5.Restaurants during holiday times can get crowded and long waiting lines are usual. Order online from the comfort of home!

    Target audience:    
    Hungry? Busy...or lazy to cook? Vegetarian/vegan friendly? This app appeals to people of all ages because it is so convenient, painless to order, and quick. This app is especially useful for singles/couples without kids who find cooking tiresome after a long day of work. 

    How target audience will use it:    
    It is very easy to install as an app from either iOS or Android app store or can be accesed via browser too. They need to sign up with their email ids when they use the app for the first time after which they can easily log in whenever ordering. They can create a profile with their favourite cuisines saved for future use. The 'Menu' icon gives them the choices of cuisines which they initially choose, after which they have the individual dishes to choose from a range of entrees, mains and desserts. The prices are mentioned alongside the dishes. If the user has any requests such as wanting extra napkins, reducing spice levels etc, there is an 'additional requests' column where they can write it down. If the user wants to customise their item like adding extra cheese or making it meatless there is an option of 'Customise item'. The 'cart' then shows the final order and price for payment.Finally, their delivery address is to be given. Once the payment is made, their order can be live tracked until collection.


Features
1. Multi-select option for user: Once user has selected the cuisine, they can select multiple dishes in one go. This helps in quicker selection of options. It also helps in reduced errors as they do not need to type in names of specific dishes.

2. Cart

2. Food customisation: If the user wants to customise their dishes such as add more cheese to their pizza, or wanting more spice levels in their curry this app has a unique feature of customising menu. Some people are really picky with their food, this feature can help them add/remove ingredients. 

3. Live tracking : When an order is placed, an almost accurate delivery time is given to the user based on the items involved and the location of delivery. Users can then track their order live - from the time its being made in the kitchen, when its being picked up, if the driver is stuck in traffic!, till it is actually delivered.
